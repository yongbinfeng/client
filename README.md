# Triton Client Libraries and Examples

Dummy triton client example to get it running with ExaTrk. Orignal code repo is [here](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/client).

## Compile the client libaries in the container
The client libraries need to be compiled with the ExaTrk docker container. Clone the client code first

```
git clone git@github.com:yongbinfeng/client.git -b 
```
